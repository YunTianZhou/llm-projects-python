Dou Dizhu (Fight the Landlord) - Rules

Objective:
The goal is to be the first to play all your cards. If the Landlord wins, they win alone. If any of the other two players win, they win as a team.

Setup:
- Players: 3
- Deck: 54 cards (including two jokers)
- Each player is dealt 17 cards, with 3 extra cards left face down.

Card Rankings (Highest to Lowest):
1. Red Joker
2. Black Joker
3. 2
4. A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3

Bidding Phase:
- Players take turns bidding for the role of the Landlord.
- The bidding starts at 1 and can go up to 3.
- The highest bid wins and that player becomes the Landlord.
- The two farmers play against the Landlord together.

Landlord Advantage:
- The Landlord plays first.
- The Landlord has 20 cards, while others have 17 each.

Gameplay:
- Players take turns in counterclockwise order.
- A player can either play a valid combination or pass.
- The round continues until two consecutive players pass, ending that sequence.
- The last player to play a valid combination starts the next sequence.

Valid Combinations:
1. Single Card
2. Pair (e.g., 7-7)
3. Triplet (e.g., 8-8-8)
4. Triplet + Single Card
5. Triplet + Pair
6. Sequence (5 or more consecutive cards, e.g., 6-7-8-9-10)
7. Sequence of Pairs (e.g., 4-4, 5-5, 6-6)
8. Sequence of Triplets (e.g., 3-3-3, 4-4-4, 5-5-5)
9. Sequence of Triplets + Single Cards (e.g. 3-3-3-4-4-4-7-8)
10. Sequence of Triplets + Pairs (e.g. 3-3-3-4-4-4-7-7-8-8)
11. Bomb (4 of a kind, beats all except Rocket or a higher Bomb)
12. Quadruple + Single + Single (e.g., 9-9-9-9-2-3)
13. Quadruple + Pair + Pair (e.g., 9-9-9-9-3-3-4-4)
14. Rocket (Red Joker + Black Joker, highest possible combination)

Valid Reactions:
- A new play must be the same type as the previous play but of higher rank (e.g., 8-8 beats 6-6).
- Bombs (four of a kind) can beat any non-bomb play.
- A higher Bomb can beat a lower Bomb.
- Rocket (double Jokers) beats everything.
- Players can pass if they do not want to or cannot play a valid combination.
- Passing does not prevent a player from playing again later when a new sequence starts.

Winning Conditions:
- The Landlord wins if they play all their cards first.
- The other two players win if either of them finishes first.
