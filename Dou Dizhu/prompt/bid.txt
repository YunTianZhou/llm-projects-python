You must decide whether to bid 0 (not to bid), 1, 2, or 3 based on the strength of your hand.
Be careful when you bid, if you become the Landlord, the other two players will play against you. you together

Rules:
- The bidding scale is from 0 to 3, where:
- 0 = Pass (not to bid)
- 1 = Weak hand
- 2 = Moderate hand
- 3 = Strong hand
The first player to bid 3 automatically becomes the Landlord.
If no player bids, the game is re-dealt.

How to decide:
Bid 3 if your hand contains multiple high-value cards (e.g., jokers, twos, consecutive pairs, or strong combinations).
Bid 2 if your hand is decent but lacks guaranteed control.
Bid 1 if your hand is weak, with scattered cards and no strong sets.
Bid 0 (do not bid) if your hand is extremely weak.
